# Anirudh (techwithanirudh) Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio built with Next.js and Fumadocs. It highlights my projects, writing, and experiments in a clean, minimal layout.

I'm Anirudh, a full-stack developer who likes shipping small, thoughtful products.
I build with Next.js, TypeScript, and a growing curiosity for AI tooling.

## Development

```bash
pnpm install
```
