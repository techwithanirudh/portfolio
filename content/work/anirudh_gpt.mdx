AnirudhGPT is a compact Next.js chat UI that wires Firebase on the client and admin sides. The app mixes App Router and legacy pages, which keeps the UI modern while preserving a straightforward routing structure for chat views and assets.

Firebase handles the data layer, with Firestore as the primary store and admin access configured for server-side operations. The UI is intentionally lightweight, using Tailwind for layout and a small component set so the chat flow stays fast to iterate.
