Classnotes Buddy is a Turborepo refactor that ships a web app and an Expo mobile client from the same workspace. The project extends the create-t3-turbo stack with Supabase Auth, Drizzle-managed schemas, and shared tooling so both apps can use a consistent notes workflow.

The repo documents the Supabase setup in detail, including auth redirect rules, SQL triggers to sync user profiles, and environment templates for local and preview deployments. Turbo pipelines handle dev/build/lint/typecheck so the monorepo stays fast even with multiple apps.
