Daily Diary is a simple React journaling UI designed around quick entry creation and a distraction-free reading experience. The interface relies on Bootstrap for layout and forms, which keeps the styling minimal while still providing responsive structure for mobile use.

The project focuses on the frontend flow—compose, list, and review entries—while leaving storage and backend integration open for later. It is built as a lightweight SPA with a straightforward component hierarchy and minimal configuration.

<Tabs items={['Highlights', 'Stack']}>
  <Tab value="Highlights">
    - Entry composer with list and detail views.
    - Bootstrap-driven layout tuned for readability.
    - Client-only workflow ready for backend integration.
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Stack">
    - React + Bootstrap.
    - Standard CRA-style build scripts.
    - Lightweight dependency footprint.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
