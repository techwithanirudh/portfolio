AniKode is a Next.js 14 website builder centered on a GrapesJS editor and a dashboard-style workflow. It combines a drag-and-drop canvas with a plugin-driven block system, then persists projects through Drizzle so users can reopen and iterate on their layouts.

Auth flows are handled through NextAuth and the UI is composed with Radix and Tailwind, which keeps the editor chrome consistent across dialogs, menus, and configuration panels. The system leans on JSON serialization for project state, so exports and previews stay close to the editor source of truth.
