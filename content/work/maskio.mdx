Maskio is a KaboomJS browser game that keeps the runtime lean while still shipping a complete gameplay loop. The project uses esbuild to bundle assets quickly and a small Express server to serve the build during development and production.

Gameplay logic stays inside Kaboom’s scene system, while the Node scripts handle build, dev, and static serving. This keeps the pipeline simple: iterate in dev with nodemon, generate a bundle with `build.js`, and serve the output with a minimal Express server.
