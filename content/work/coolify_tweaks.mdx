Coolify Tweaks is a TurboRepo monorepo that packages a Stylus userstyle, a Nitro API for serving dynamic CSS, and a docs site for onboarding. The core deliverable is the UI override layer, but the API and docs keep installs fresh and easy to update.

The style package focuses on spacing, typography, and layout consistency in the Coolify dashboard. Installation is supported through direct userstyle links, userstyles.world, or proxy injection, with detailed docs and screenshot comparisons to verify changes.
