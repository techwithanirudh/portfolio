Shadcn SaaS Landing is a Next.js 16 template that combines a marketing site with a Fumadocs-powered documentation section. It ships shadcn/ui components, Tailwind tokens, and motion-driven UI touches while keeping the content pipeline clean and typed.

The project includes Drizzle scripts and Better Auth hooks for teams that want a data layer, plus React Email/Resend wiring for onboarding or contact flows. It is designed to be a strong starting point for SaaS teams that need both a landing page and a docs hub.
