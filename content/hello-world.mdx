Welcome! I’m **Winter**, a forum fanatic, an all‑round community guy.  
This site is my new basecamp for everything I’m cooking up: notes on growing friendly online spaces, and a sprinkle of chess tactics.

I’ll keep posts informal, think behind‑the‑scenes drama, moderation war stories, and the odd meme when the mood strikes. 

Have a look around, smash that contact form if you spot something off, and check back soon—first proper article drops next month. Glad you’re here!
