Welcome! I'm **Anirudh**. I like building web and AI projects.  
This site is my basecamp for sharing projects, experiments, and lessons from recent builds and ideas.

I'll keep posts informal behind-the-scenes builds, research notes, and demos from my latest work.

Have a look around, say hello if something sparks your interest, and check back soon for more updates. Glad you're here!
