Hello everyone,

Today, I'd like to share the story behind the profile photo you see across my Tech with Anirudh presence.

Previously, I was an admin on a vibrant forum named "Coders Airbus." The community, founded and managed by Michele, flourished as a private forum with over 2,000 active members. We spent nearly four wonderful years sharing ideas, collaborating, and enjoying the camaraderie.

Unfortunately, Michele, the heart and soul of the community, fell seriously ill. In anticipation of the uncertainty ahead, she shared a heartfelt message with us about the future of the forum. Shortly thereafter, she made the difficult decision to close the forum permanently.

My current profile picture was originally Michele’s. I adopted it as a tribute, serving as a lasting reminder of our vibrant community, the friendships forged, and the memories we created during those unforgettable times.

Thank you for reading. I look forward to sharing more stories and updates with you in future newsletters and blogs.
