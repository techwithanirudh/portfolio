    description:
      "Some say 10x developers do not exist. I have met several, of which Anirudh. I had the opportunity to work with Anirudh on a web app project in React JS / Node and some Python modules. Not only did Anirudh work really fast and well, he foresaw some technical limitations and implemented ingenious solutions. Most impressive to me was his ability to read documentation in areas he didn't know, and master them quickly.",
